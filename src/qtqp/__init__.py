"""Interior point method for solving QPs.

  Algorithm: Mehrotra predictor-corrector interior point method with a
  homogeneous embedding. Each iteration does:

    1. Normalize (x, y, tau, s) to have the norm of the central path.
    2. Pre-solve K^{-1} @ [c; b] (shared between predictor and corrector steps).
    3. Predictor step: Newton direction with mu_target=0 (no centering).
    4. Compute sigma (centering parameter) from predictor step quality.
    5. Corrector step: Newton direction with mu_target=sigma*mu and
       Mehrotra's second-order correction to improve complementarity.
    6. Update iterates and check termination.

  The embedding augments the problem with a homogeneous variable tau so the
  algorithm can detect primal/dual infeasibility without a separate Phase I.

  NONE:

  RUIZ:
    Ruiz equilibration on the KKT block [P, A'; A, 0] plus two scalars.
    Symmetric diagonal scalings D (rows) and E (columns) are chosen so that,
    at each pass, the inf-norm of every row of D A E and every column of
    [D A E ; E P E] is driven toward 1. Each pass then applies the two scalar
    factors a QP admits without changing its solution set:

        sigma: a joint scale on (b, c), i.e. a rescale of the solution,
               taking ||b||_inf to 1;
        gamma: a scale on the objective (P, c), i.e. a rescale of the
               duals, taking max(||c||_inf, max |P_ij|) to 1.

    So A_eq = D A E, P_eq = gamma E P E, b_eq = sigma D b and
    c_eq = sigma gamma E c. b and c never enter D or E: the factorized block
    keeps unit rows and columns, and only the scalars absorb their magnitude.
    Both scalars are kept within [1e-4, 1e4].

  AUGMENTED:
    Ruiz equilibration on the symmetric augmented matrix

        M = [ P    A^T   c ]
            [ A     0   -b ]
            [ c^T -b^T   0 ]

    so b and c participate in determining the row/column norms rather than
    only moving the scalars. The scaling has three blocks (E for x columns,
    D for y rows, and a scalar sigma for the augmented row/column), giving

        A_eq = D A E,    P_eq = E P E,
        b_eq = sigma * (D b),   c_eq = sigma * (E c).

    The sigma factor maps to the homogenization variable (tau_orig =
    sigma * tau_eq), so iterate (un)equilibration must apply 1/sigma to
    keep the recovered x/tau, y/tau, s/tau in the original scale. This
    strategy has no objective scale (gamma == 1).

  ) -> Solution:
    """Solves the QP using a primal-dual interior-point method.

    Args:
      tol_feas (float): Feasibility tolerance. SOLVED requires the primal
        residual ||Ax + s - b|| / max(1, ||b||_inf + ||x|| + ||s||) and the
        dual residual ||Px + A'y + c|| / max(1, ||c||_inf + ||x|| + ||y||)
        (2-norms, evaluated on the returned point) to be below it. These
        are Clarabel's criteria, so results are directly comparable.
      tol_gap_abs (float): Absolute duality-gap tolerance; SOLVED requires
        |pcost - dcost| below it OR the relative gap below tol_gap_rel.
      tol_gap_rel (float): Relative duality-gap tolerance, against
        max(1, min(|pcost|, |dcost|)).
      tol_infeas_abs (float): A certificate requires its objective slope
        (b'y for infeasibility, c'x for unboundedness) below
        -tol_infeas_abs.
      tol_infeas_rel (float): A certificate requires its violations, relative
        to max(1, ||ray||), to be below tol_infeas_rel * |slope|.
      certificate_ktratio (float): Certificates are considered only when the
        embedding ratio kappa / tau exceeds this (SOLVED requires it below
        1). The default 1e9 is Clarabel's; here kappa is eliminated through
        tau * kappa = mu, so the ratio is mu / tau^2, which grows like
        1 / tau on the certificate side and so crosses any threshold.
      max_iter (int): Maximum number of iterations before stopping.
      step_size_scale (float): A factor in (0, 1) to scale the step size,
        ensuring iterates remain strictly interior.
      min_static_regularization (float): Minimum regularization value used in
        the KKT matrix diagonal for numerical stability.
      max_iterative_refinement_steps (int): Maximum iterative refinement steps
        for the linear solves (includes the initial solve, so must be >= 1).
      linear_solver_atol (float): Absolute tolerance for the iterative
        refinement process within the linear solver.
      linear_solver_rtol (float): Relative tolerance for the iterative
        refinement process within the linear solver.
      linear_solver (LinearSolver): The linear solver to use when solving the
        KKT system.
      verbose (bool): If True, prints a summary of each iteration.
      equilibration_strategy (EquilibrationStrategy): Which scaling to apply
        to (A, P, b, c) before iterating. See EquilibrationStrategy for
        descriptions. Defaults to RUIZ.
      collect_stats (bool): If True, collect per-iteration stats (sy, s_over_y
        statistics, complementarity, etc.) and return them in Solution.stats.
        Defaults to False for faster throughput; set True when per-iteration
        diagnostics are needed.
      refinement_strategy (RefinementStrategy): Which iterative-refinement
        scheme drives each KKT solve. See RefinementStrategy for
        descriptions. Defaults to GMRES: at a full-budget restart length
        it ties or beats Richardson on every benchmark dataset
        (Maros-Meszaros + NETLIB + MIPLIB at 1e-9: +5 MIPLIB solves
        including the heaviest instance inside its time limit, ~6% less
        total wall time, 22x fewer stalled sub-solves), with the
        deep-endgame tail reshuffled rather than degraded. RICHARDSON
        remains available as the classical smoother.
      gmres_restart (int): Krylov dimension per GMRES restart cycle. Each
        inner Arnoldi step consumes one factor-solve. Defaults to 20 --
        one uninterrupted cycle spanning the full refinement budget
        (max_iterative_refinement_steps), which avoids restart
        stagnation; shorter cycles reduce orthogonalization cost at the
        price of more restarts. Ignored when refinement_strategy is
        RICHARDSON.
      warm_start (tuple | None): Optional (x, y, s) from a nearby problem
        (original scale, e.g. a previous Solution's arrays). The point is
        equilibrated into the operating scale and embedded interior using
        four positivity floors. The candidate with the smallest guarded
        local-norm residual score is accepted when lambda <=
        warm_start_threshold; otherwise the standard initialization runs.
        This is an empirical screen, not a distance certificate or a
        no-slowdown guarantee. Screening shares A@x and P@x across candidates
        and costs six matvecs total; an accepted score is reused as
        `lambda_init`. After solve, `warm_lambda` (the minimum score, or None
        when screening was skipped) and `warm_accepted` are available as
        attributes on the solver. All-equality problems skip screening.
      warm_start_threshold (float): Positive finite threshold for the
        empirical warm-start screen (default 100.0). It does not bound the
        distance to the path or the subsequent solve's iteration count.
      adaptive_step_size (bool): If True (the default), once mu < 1e-3
        the fraction-to-boundary scale follows min(0.9999,
        max(step_size_scale, 1 - 10*mu)) instead of the constant
        step_size_scale: the margin to the cone boundary shrinks
        proportionally to mu, unlocking the superlinear endgame that the
        constant 1% haircut caps at a linear rate. Isolation-validated on
        Maros-Meszaros + NETLIB + MIPLIB at 1e-9 (+10 net solved
        instances including two time-limit rescues, no detection changes,
        slightly faster overall; the historical stall risk on marginal
        instances did not reproduce under the current endgame
        safeguards). Set False for the constant legacy schedule.
      max_centrality_correctors (int): Maximum number of Gondzio-style
        multiple centrality correctors per iteration. Each corrector costs
        one back-solve on the existing factorization (kinv_q is shared),
        recentering the aspirational trial point's outlier complementarity
        products, and is accepted only if the step size improves.
        Correctors are skipped when the step size is already >= 0.9.
        The default 1 was validated on NETLIB + Maros-Meszaros (cuts
        iterations ~10%, rescues borderline instances, no regressions);
        0 disables.

    Returns:
